# OWSM: OPA WRAPPER STATE MANAGER
This is a simple Go wrapper around OPA! 
It allows saving the state of evaluated rules written in Rego.

More precisely it saves the **state** composite value of Rego, in the **datastore** server

## Structure
This repository is organized as follow:
- The `src` folder contians implementations of the project;
- The `examples` folder contains two use cases in which OWSM fits perfectly;
- The `experiments` folder contains a pipline for replicate experiments presenten in the ITASEC 2025 conference
